# ember-spin.js

An Ember.js component for displaying a spinning loading indicator using spin.js.

BE AWARE that you'll need to define an empty `components/ic-spinner` template 
or this won't work. See [this issue](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/3231)
if you (like me) think this is unfortunate.

See [here for a demo](http://aexmachina.github.io/ember-spin.js/).
